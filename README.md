# Sudo Workshop

In this repo you can find configuration examples for my ```sudo workshop```.

Slides for the workshop are available at [https://peter.czanik.hu/pts2023/](https://peter.czanik.hu/pts2023/)

As you might have guessed from the directory name, this workshop was originally prepared for the [Pass the SALT Conference](https://pass-the-salt.org/).

You can find original sudo 1.9.15 configurations in the ```orig``` directory. Each directory implements a minimally modified sudo configuration for a specific use case. Check the slides for details.

Have fun, while learning some interesting sudo features!
